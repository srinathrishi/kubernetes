h2. Kubernetes Namespace Naming Convention

To help manage multi-tenancy in our Kubernetes environment, we've established a naming convention for namespaces that all app teams should follow. This convention will help ensure consistency and easy identification of namespace names across different teams and applications.

h3. Convention

Each Kubernetes namespace should have three words separated by '-':

{code}<team-name>-<app-name>-<environment>{code}

Where:
- <team-name> is the name of the team deploying the application. This should be a single word without any dashes.
- <app-name> is the name of the application being deployed. This should also be a single word without any dashes.
- <environment> is the environment the application is being deployed to. This could be "dev", "staging", "prod", or any other environment name that makes sense for our organization.

h3. Example

Let's say the IT-CSI team is deploying the Aqua-Sec application in the dev environment. The Kubernetes namespace name should be:

{code}itcsi-aquasec-dev{code}

h3. Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when creating Kubernetes namespaces:
- Use lowercase letters only.
- Do not use any special characters or spaces.
- Avoid using numbers in the namespace name.
- If your team or application name contains a dash (-), please remove it from the namespace name.

h3. Benefits

By following this naming convention, we can achieve the following benefits:
- Easy identification of which team and application the namespace belongs to.
- Consistency across different teams and applications, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot our Kubernetes environment.
- Clear separation between different environments, helping to prevent mistakes such as deploying to the wrong environment.

If you have any questions or concerns about this naming convention, please reach out to the DevOps team.
